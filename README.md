## Project Summary <a name = "summary"></a>

The project is designed to provide a solution to the problem that many people with disabilities who use power recliner chairs or remote controlled hospital beds with reduced mobility cannot push the buttons on their chairs/beds' remote controls with physical power. The challenge was introduced by [TetraSociety](https://makerepo.com/project_proposals/350.makercon-voice-activated-chair-remote).

A design solution comprising of 5 cascading communicating components to achieve a voice activated, software+hardware driven mechanical system was layed out.
- Command based voice recognition (implemented on Android Studio)
- Text filtering/parsing and generating data packets containing control signals (implemented on Android Studio)
- Android Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client/peripheral system 
- Arduino ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server/center system
- Mechanical servo system controlled by Arduino ESP32 

The project required multiple
